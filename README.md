## Fan RPM, temperature and humidity monitor

An interrupt-driven approach to measuring RPM with microsecond accuracy.

Most approaches count an integral number of 'ticks' per period giving an RPM which is inaccurate and varies in ugly discrete steps.

My approach measures both whole and partial revolution periods giving a much more accurate RPM.
