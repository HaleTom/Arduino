## RPM, temperature, and humidity monitor

An interrupt-driven, fractional cycle approach to measuring RPM with microsecond accuracy.

Most approaches count an integral number of 'ticks' per period giving an RPM which is inaccurate and varies in ugly discrete steps.

This approach measures both whole and partial revolutions giving a much more accurate RPM.
